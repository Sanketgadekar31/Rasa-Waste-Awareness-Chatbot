  utter_sensor_used:
  - text: "The smart bin utilizes an advanced ultrasonic sensor, temprature sensor and infrared sensors (IR) to accurately measure the fill level, keep optimal conditions and make lid opening in smart and hands-free respectively."

  utter_temp_sensor:
  - text: "The temperature sensor in the smart bin is continuously monitoring and ensuring optimal conditions. This helps in managing waste efficiently and maintaining a healthy environment."
  - text: "The smart bin is equipped with a temperature sensor to monitor environmental conditions. It helps ensure optimal waste management by providing insights into temperature variations."

  utter_IR_sensor:
  - text: "Our smart bins are equipped with advanced infrared sensors, ensuring a seamless and hands-free experience. As you approach, the bin detects your presence and gracefully opens its lids, making waste disposal effortless."
  - text: "The smart bin is equipped with infrared (IR) sensors that detect the presence of a person in front of it. These sensors work by emitting infrared light and measuring the reflection. When someone approaches the bin, the sensors detect their presence and trigger the mechanism to automatically open the bin lids, providing a convenient and hands-free waste disposal experience."

  utter_ultra_sensor:
  - text: "Our smart bin is equipped with advanced ultrasonic sensors to intelligently monitor its fill level. These sensors utilize cutting-edge technology to precisely measure the waste volume. You can count on our smart bin to optimize waste collection and contribute to efficient waste management in real-time."
  - text: "With our innovative ultrasonic sensor technology, our smart bins can precisely monitor their fill levels in real-time. You'll receive timely alerts when it's time for collection or disposal."
